Going further
I hope this article helped you to see what’s possible with the `rebase` command. Of course, the best way to learn Git is to use it, but the second best way is to read about it. If you’d like to read more, I highly recommend the Pro Git book – specifically the section about rebase itself. And, because once in a while we all end up in a bad situation, you should probably take a look at Data Recovery in the Maintenance and Data Recovery section. If you’re not into reading the whole documentation, maybe you’d prefer these Git Flight Rules.

Have additional rebase tips or feedback on this post? We’d love to hear them: @aseure or @Algolia. Thanks for reading – and happy Gitting!
